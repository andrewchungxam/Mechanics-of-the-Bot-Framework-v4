# Microsoft-Bot-Framework-v4
The Microsoft Bot Framework provides what you need to build and connect intelligent bots that interact naturally wherever your users are talking, from text/sms to Skype, Slack, Office 365 mail and other popular services. http://botframework.com

This repository is meant to create an interative, step-by-step, progressive look at the new Bot Framework v4.  Inspiration and credit to Microsoft MVP, James Mann, and his excellent teaching style and tutorials: github.com/jamesemann and the Microsoft Documentation Team's official Bot Framework v4 samples: https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples
